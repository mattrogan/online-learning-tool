# Online Learning Tool

This is the implementation of an online learning tool as part of my final year project. The online learning tool has been developed as part of an experimental study, to increase attitudes, motivations and perceptions of online learning for technical modules. 

## How the tool works
The tool is to be used as follows:
1. Go through the **learning materials** to learn about the topics
2. Attempt the **practical exercises** to consolidate your learning
3. Place any questions in the **discussion forum**
4. Finally, attempt the **assessment quiz** to evaluate your understanding

## Questions about the tool
Any queries about the tool should be directed to Matt Rogan on mr1360@york.ac.uk
