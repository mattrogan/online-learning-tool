# Online Learning Tool

This is the implementation of an online learning tool as part of my final year project. The online learning tool has been developed as part of an experimental study, to increase attitudes, motivations and perceptions of online learning for technical modules.

The tool is no longer running live, but the source code can be found in this repository.

## How the tool works
The tool is used as follows:
1. Go through the **learning materials** to learn about the topics
2. Attempt the **practical exercises** to consolidate your learning
3. Place any questions in the **discussion forum**
4. Finally, attempt the **assessment quiz** to evaluate your understanding

## Future development?
In the future, I may revisit this - the Magnum Opus of my three years at Uni of York! - to see if I can recreate it in a far superior stack to Flask, but this isn't a priority or something I wish to pursue at this very moment in time.

## Dissertation findings
If anyone wishes to discuss the outcome of my dissertation and what was found from the experimental study, get in touch! Happy to chat over the findings and how effective the tool was found to be.
